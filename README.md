# Welcome to my academical website ! 

## Presentation
I am a postdoctoral researcher at CentraleSupelec Paris with Anne GOELZER (MIAT, INRAE, France) and Veronique LETORT (MICS, CentraleSupelec Paris, France), where I work on statistics applied to biology. In particular, I am working on the Arabidopsis thaliana plant and seeking to improve plant growth modeling on several scales: the RBA model to better understand resource allocation at the cellular level, and the GreenLab model to more accurately simulate organ development, in order to make simulations more realistic and adaptable to different genotypes and experimental conditions. I am still working on estimation algorithm, but now on direct optimization or using simulation. 

Last year, I defended my thesis, which is called ***"Extension of hidden (semi-)Markov models and algorithms for estimating the dynamics of partially observable (meta)populations."*** I worked on it with Nathalie PEYRARD (MIAT, INRAE, France), Pierre-Olivier CHEPTOU (CEFE, CNRS, France), and Nikolaos LIMNIOS (LMAC, CNRS, France). Over the last three years, I've been working on various temporal graphical models (HMM, HSMM, DBN). I've extended them to model the dynamics of both populations and metapopulations, taking into account spatial interactions between populations. I've also studied the theoretical properties of some of these models (identifiability, consistency) and developed or manipulated associated estimation algorithms (exact and approximate EM, ABC approach). 

## Research interests
- Data analysis. 
- Development of estimation methods.
- Applications to ecology and biology.
