### Perspectives
A four-act investigative game in which each player has different information/perspectives about what happened. Together, they must share their insights to solve the case.  
- **Drawback:** Once the four investigations are completed, it cannot be replayed.  
- **Duration:** About 1 hour per investigation, similar to classic investigative games like *Unlock*.  
- **Learning curve:** Very easy—just dive in and enjoy the story.

### Bomb Busters
A cooperative game where the goal is to cut all the wires of a detonator except the one connected to the bomb. Each player has hidden wires numbered 1 to 12 in front of them, and they must cut a wire matching one of the numbers in another player's hand.  
- **Mechanics:** Since the game is cooperative, players give clues about the position of each number and the bomb in their hands to help decide which wire to cut.  
- **Advantages:** The game includes 66 missions with increasing difficulty, allowing for long-term play.  
- **Learning curve:** Easy, with 3 tutorial missions to start.  
- **Duration:** About 30 minutes per session.  
- **Drawback:** It’s a bit hard to find right now due to its recent release and popularity.

### Splendor
A strategy game where players act as merchants collecting gems and bonuses to gain prestige and nobility.  
- **Objective:** The first player to reach 15 prestige points wins.  
- **Learning curve:** Quick to learn (5–10 minutes).  
- **Game duration:** About 30 minutes.  
- **Variety:** Games vary depending on players' skill levels and strategies.  
- **Personal note:** I own the duel version, which is great, though the standard version can also be played with two players.

An expert-level game where each player controls an army of animals and must complete specific missions to win.

- **Game duration:** 1 to 1.5 hours.  
- **Advantages:** Being an expert game, it’s highly comprehensive and allows for skill development over time.

### Secret Hitler
A party game where players are divided into two camps: liberals and fascists (one of whom is Hitler).  
- **Mechanics:**  
  - A hidden-role game where players don’t know each other’s roles, except the fascists, who know one another and know who Hitler is.  
  - In each round, a “President - Chancellor” pair is proposed and must enact laws (either liberal or fascist) without revealing their roles.  
- **Objectives:**  
  - Fascists: Pass a certain number of fascist laws or elect Hitler as Chancellor.  
  - Liberals: Prevent Hitler from becoming Chancellor, identify the fascists, and pass liberal laws.  
- **Game style:** A bluffing game that’s highly entertaining.  
- **Game duration:** 30 to 45 minutes, depending on how well players bluff.  
- **Learning curve:** Very easy to pick up and play.
