Presentation
===
I've just defended my thesis, which is called ***"Extension of hidden (semi-)Markov models and algorithms for estimating the dynamics of partially observable (meta)populations."*** I worked on it with Nathalie PEYRARD (MIAT, INRAE, France), Pierre-Olivier CHEPTOU (CEFE, CNRS, France), and Nikolaos LIMNIOS (LMAC, CNRS, France). Over the last three years, I've been working on various temporal graphical models (HMM, HSMM, DBN). I've extended them to model the dynamics of both populations and metapopulations, taking into account spatial interactions between populations. I've also studied the theoretical properties of some of these models (identifiability, consistency) and developed or manipulated associated estimation algorithms (exact and approximate EM, ABC approach). 

Research interests
===
- Graphical models, in the temporal case with the presence of latent variables (e.g. H(S)MM or dynamic Bayesian networks). 
- Development or use of associated estimation methods.
- Applications to ecology
